\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we consider a distributed and asynchronous job dispatching design in an edge computing network residing in a MAN with multiple APs and edge servers.
The APs and edge servers periodically broadcast their local state information to facilitate distributed dispatcher design.
Due to random transmission latency, the system information observed at different dispatchers are asynchronous.
We also consider a practical scenario that not all the state information can be observed by each AP.
Hence, the distributed optimization of job dispatching strategies at all the APs is formulated as a POMDP, whose minimization objective is a discount measurement of job delivery and computation time.
We propose a novel low-complexity distributed solution framework, called \algname, based on analytical approximation of value function and one-step policy iteration, where the complicated POMDP solution or value iteration is avoided. Both the analytical and semi-analytical performance lower bounds are derived for the approximate MDP solution.
\revision{Furthermore}, to handle a general scenario where the statistics of signaling latency, uploading latency and computation time are unknown in advance, an efficient online learning approach is proposed.
The simulation results show that the proposed solution framework outperforms various heuristic baselines.
