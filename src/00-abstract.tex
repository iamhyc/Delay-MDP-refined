        %NOTE: (1) random latency matters; why random latency matters;
        Random transmission latency is appeared as a non-negligible issue in edge computing systems when implementing distributed scheduler in a large network such as Metropolitan Area Network (MAN).
        With the random latency of information sharing among distributed schedulers, the shared system status information would inevitably become outdated and thus lower the system performance.
        %NOTE: (2) online/distributed/cooperative/job dispatching/outdated information
        In this paper, we investigate an online distributed cooperative job dispatching problem in an edge computing system residing in a MAN, where multiple access points (APs) collect jobs from the mobile users and upload each job to one edge server for computation.
        %NOTE: (3) the signaling mechanism (information sharing); partial information;
        A signaling mechanism is introduced to facilitate information sharing among distributed schedulers on each AP via periodic broadcast.
        As the signaling latency is random and reception of all broadcast information in a MAN is time consuming, the schedulers have to make job dispatching decisions individually according to partially received and outdated broadcast information.
        %NOTE: (4) technical contribution: POMDP; low-complexity solution with bound; RL;
        Hence, we formulate the distributed job dispatching problem by leveraging the partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and propose a novel low-complexity approximate MDP solution framework, called \algname, to avoid the huge time complexity of conventional POMDP solutions.
        {An analytical performance lower bound is derived for the approximate MDP solution and a semi-analytical lower bound is provided for quick performance evaluation.}
        Furthermore, we extend \algname~to handle a more general scenario where the priori statistics are unknown.
        %NOTE: (5) the simulation and performance improvement
        Finally, we conduct extensive simulations based on the Google Cluster trace.
        % The evaluation results show that our policy can achieve as high as $11.21\%$ reduction in average job response time compared with heuristic baselines,

        and our algorithm consistently performs well under various parameter settings.
